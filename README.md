# Calculator Exercise

<p>This is a repository for a simple calculator.</p>

<p>The calculator is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

#### [Design Inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/14709020-Calculator) - Shout out to [Lucia Soctt](https://dribbble.com/luciascott)

<p>The main idea of the exercise was to practice JavaScript. 
Had several stumbling stones for this exercise, like how to remove one / last character from the output and how to convert the output after the % button is being used.</p>

I used the **[slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)** method and the **[eval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval)** function for those two tasks.
